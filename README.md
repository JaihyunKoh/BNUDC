# BNUDC: A Two-Branched Deep Neural Network for Restoring Images from Under-Display Cameras
This is the implementation of [BNUDC: A Two-Branched Deep Neural Network for Restoring Images from Under-Display Cameras](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/Koh_BNUDC_A_Two-Branched_Deep_Neural_Network_for_Restoring_Images_From_CVPR_2022_paper.html) (CVPR, 2022).


Now constructing....
## How to run
You can train or test our BNUDC by changing options; exp_name; and data_root in ```options/base_options.py```

## Dataset
The datasets are available at [POLED](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M1mE-MfSPiMhj1fRvfFMhkRRa3mvEocJ/view?usp=sharing) containing the pre-processed UDC images, [TOLED](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ig6BROpAI-2fgM9YnIquyM5LMe2UY4Qq/view?usp=sharing) and [SYNTH](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ctYHU70TZlQzVwAR4yOA1G-c1gsaWqzX/view?usp=sharing)

## Pretrained
The three sets of the pre-trained weights for these datasets can be downloaded at [CHECHPOINTS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vQrVLwTHrF8IeQKUCbo1hM9V07JqA0VT/view?usp=sharing).
